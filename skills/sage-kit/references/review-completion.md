# Review And Completion

Acceptance, review, corrective, and release work load the complete Skill and
this profile once for the active task, even when the originating work used only
the Light project kernel. Handoff and closeout load it when governance is
Standard or Heavy or current project authority selects the full profile.

Review the active diff against current authority, acceptance criteria, affected
contracts, tests, security boundaries, and evidence. Return one bounded finding
set.

Evaluate capability and evidence claims through
[`CLAIM_EVIDENCE_TRUST.md`](../../../docs/agent/CLAIM_EVIDENCE_TRUST.md). Review
only the affected boundary, and do not let descendants or nested workflows
repeat the same review of an unchanged candidate.

- P0/P1 block.
- P2 blocks only for authority conflict, false-green, approval gate, safety
  boundary, or validator/required project-check failure.
- Ordinary P2 may be accepted with concerns or corrected directly.
- P3 does not block.

Mechanical wording, status, and EOF fixes close with a focused check. Semantic
correctives receive one targeted re-review of the affected boundary. Repeat a
full review only after permission, source-authority, or broad cross-boundary
scope changes.

Continue while findings decrease inside the same authorized corrective scope,
without asking for new approval each round. Two consecutive no-progress rounds
for the same root cause return `BLOCKED`.

Implementation completion, review verdict, submit authorization, and human
acceptance remain separate. Closeout records the accepted outcome; it never
creates acceptance. A handoff reports authority, changed surfaces, checks,
review evidence, concerns, skipped work, blockers, next action, and next owner.
