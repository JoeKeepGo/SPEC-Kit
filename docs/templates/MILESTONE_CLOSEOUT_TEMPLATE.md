# M<ID> Milestone Closeout: <Name>

Use this file when closing a milestone.

Completion eligibility is canonical at
`docs/SAGE_CORE.md#sage-completion-001`. This template records a historical
accepted/closed outcome and does not decide completion or acceptance.

Waiver meaning is canonical at
`docs/agent/GOVERNANCE_LEVELS.md#sage-auth-008`. This closeout retains the
project-instance Check Owner, named human Waiver Authority, named human
Acceptance Owner, and separate acceptance decision fields.

This file is a historical outcome index, not startup context. Keep it concise
enough to answer what happened, what shipped, what remains, and where to find
evidence without rereading every phase document.

Completed closeout target size: 80-150 lines. Link to ledgers, phase docs,
completion reports, and change refs instead of copying raw evidence tables or
command output.

## Outcome

- Status: `DONE`, `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS`, `CLOSED_BLOCKED`, `DEFERRED`,
  `ABANDONED`, or `SUPERSEDED`
- Closed on: `<date or change ref>`
- Owner: `<owner>`
- Final Review verdict/ref:
- Corrective convergence status/ref:
- Acceptance Owner: `<named human>`
- Acceptance decision/ref: `<accepted, rejected, or not requested + ref>`
- Change refs: `<commit, PR, changelist, release, or n/a>`

Record no `HANDOFF` closeout. Use `CLOSED_BLOCKED`, `DEFERRED`, or `ABANDONED`
only after the canonical closeout sequence produces that authorized decision.

## Archive Notes

- Do not use this file as default startup context.
- Read this file before opening historical ledgers or phase docs.
- Open detailed evidence only when the closeout does not answer the current
  question or provenance must be verified.
