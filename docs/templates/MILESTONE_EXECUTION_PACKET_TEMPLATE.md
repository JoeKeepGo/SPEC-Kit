# Milestone Execution Packet Template

Use this packet only when an explicit Heavy/formal profile or project authority
selects a formal Project Manager Controller to Coder Controller transfer. It is
not a default Standard handoff. Omit every conditional section that does not
apply; the remaining depth is available for complex milestone, wave, phase,
Graph, rollback, and review coordination.

Level/permission and submit semantics are canonical at
`docs/agent/GOVERNANCE_LEVELS.md#sage-auth-004` and
`docs/agent/GOVERNANCE_LEVELS.md#sage-auth-007`. This packet retains every
applicable project-instance field that assigns those boundaries to controllers
and workers.

```markdown
Milestone:

Objective:

Primary Capability:

Source Docs:
- Project authority / active SPEC:
- Current context: `<project-selected path/system or omitted>`
- Document routing: `<project-selected path or omitted>`
- Entry gate: `<project-selected authority or omitted>`
- Milestone history/evidence index: `<project-selected path or omitted>`
- Capability claims owner: `<active SPEC/acceptance criteria/map or omitted>`
- Phase authority: `<project-selected paths or omitted>`
- Quality gates: `<project-selected authority or omitted>`
- Approval gates: `<instantiated project/host gates or omitted>`

Execution Mode:
- `Phase Execution`, `Wave Execution`, or `Session Orchestration`

Governance:
- Controller level: `Light`, `Standard`, or `Heavy`
- Why this level:
- Controls Enabled:
- Controls Not Enabled:

Permission Mode:
- Coder Controller mode: `READ_ONLY_REVIEW` or `WRITE_AUTHORIZED`
- Why this mode:
- Controller-owned writable files only:
- Worker-owned implementation files: `<Coder Controller must not edit>`
- Project Manager final decision authority: `<separate PM decision record; not Final Review acceptance>`
- Final Review mode: `READ_ONLY_REVIEW`
- Final Review corrective orchestration authorized: `<yes/no; does not grant controller writes>`
- Existing corrective authority and scope: `<authority reference or none>`
- Convergence rule: `docs/agent/EXECUTION_ECONOMY.md#sage-loop-008`
- Environment-write authority:
- Isolated-lane local commit authority: `<yes/no + exact worktree/scope>`
- Submit/push/merge/release authority: `<separate explicit authority or none>`
- Destructive cleanup authority: `<separate explicit authority or none>`
- Permission upgrade requires:

Execution Shape:
- `SERIAL`, `PARALLEL_WITH_WAVES`, `PARALLEL_PHASES`, or `STOP_FOR_PM`
- Canonical Graph admission and execution-shape semantics:
  `docs/SAGE_CORE.md#sage-grf-001` and
  `docs/agent/WAVE_EXECUTION.md#sage-grf-002`

Dependency DAG:
- `<phase/lane>` depends on `<phase/lane or none>` because `<contract/evidence/gate>`

Parallel candidates:
- `<phases or phase-internal lanes with disjoint ownership>`

Serial barriers:
- `<shared file, gate, runtime owner, integration point, or dependency>`

Parallelism Rationale:
- `<project-specific dependency, ownership, gate, runtime constraint, or reason
  one bounded loop is sufficient under the canonical rules>`

Wave Readiness:
- Useful parallel lanes:
- Exclusive writable files:
- Shared files kept serial:
- Shared-file controller/integration owner:
- Contracts frozen before writable work:
- Runtime ownership:
- Validation lanes:
- Integration owner:
- Conflict stop conditions:
- Decision: `SERIAL`, `PARALLEL_WITH_WAVES`, `PARALLEL_PHASES`, or `STOP_FOR_PM`

Controller Launch Guidance:
- Use a Compact Controller Launch Envelope when the controller can read this
  packet and its authority references locally.
- Include role and objective, authority references, baseline or entry
  condition, permission mode, PM authority deltas, terminal state, and only
  necessary prohibitions or stop conditions.
- The launch envelope must not duplicate the execution packet.
- 40-80 lines is a guideline, not a correctness gate.
- Worker prompts remain explicit and carry their exact files, tests, evidence,
  runtime ownership, and stop conditions.
- PM authority deltas in the envelope must record authority ID, source,
  priority, and reconciliation destination.
- Classify launch deltas and authority gaps under
  `docs/agent/AGENT_HARNESS.md#sage-auth-010`. This packet retains the referenced
  authority, field values, and reconciliation destination used by that rule.

Coder Controller Integration Edit Policy:
- Direct controller edits allowed: `<yes/no>`
- Allowed only for: `<named controller-owned integration or packet files/n/a>`
- Maximum files or surfaces:
- Worker dispatch required for:
- Direct edits forbidden when: `<any file is worker-owned>`
- Selected result/handoff must explain skipped worker dispatch: `<yes/no>`

Worktree Isolation Policy:
- Allowed mode: `NONE`, `MILESTONE_WORKTREE`, `PHASE_WORKTREE`, `LANE_WORKTREE`, or `REVIEW_WORKTREE`
- Maximum worktree count:
- Branch naming:
- Worktree naming:
- Base branch or commit:
- Allowed phases or lanes:
- Shared files that remain serial:
- Runtime ownership:
- Integration owner:
- Review worktree creator: `<Coder or named Workspace/Environment Controller; created before review handoff>`
- Post-verdict submit owner:
- Post-verdict cleanup policy:
- Forbidden scenarios:

Structured Record Policy:
- Active: `<yes/no>`
- Contract or project policy:
- Task/evidence locations:
- Required evidence levels:
- Project-native check:
- Acceptance gate covered:
- Record update owner:

Capability Discovery:
- Adapter contract: `docs/agent/CAPABILITY_ADAPTERS.md#sage-adp-003`
- Capability registry checked: `<yes/no/not available>`
- Runtime/model family:
- Execution method owner: `<MODEL_NATIVE / ADAPTER>`
- Native workflow coverage: `<brainstorming, planning, TDD, debugging, subagent orchestration, review, verification, branch completion>`
- External workflow bundles loaded: `<none by default / explicitly selected>`
- Descendant boundary inheritance:
- SAGE-Kit boundary: `<scope/files/gates/evidence controlled by this packet>`
- Selected skills:
- Selected plugins/connectors:
- Selected tools:
- Selected capability adapters:
- Adapter authorization levels:
- Adapter fallback policy:
- Forbidden capabilities:
- Worker must check own capability list: `<yes/no>`
- Fallback if capability is missing:
- External planning output destination:
- External capability completion counts as: `execution evidence only`

Final Candidate Identity:
- Expected branch/revision:
- Expected staged/unstaged/untracked scope:
- Relevant diff or change reference:
- Final project CI required: `<yes/no + authority>`
- Candidate identity does not grant local commit, external publication,
  destructive cleanup, or acceptance authority: `<confirmed>`

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

|---|---|---|
| `<file>` | `<named controller or integration owner>` | `<serial-only; workers propose patches>` |

- Apply `docs/agent/EXECUTION_ECONOMY.md#sage-loop-008` directly under the

  authority.

Approval Gates:

Runtime Ownership:

ACTIVE_CONTEXT durable-truth update requirements (only when changed):

Immutable ledger event-index requirements (only when selected):

Closeout Requirement:

Stop Conditions:

Expected Coder Output:
- `<project-selected result/handoff shape; formal result packet only when selected>`
