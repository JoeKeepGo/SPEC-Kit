# M<ID> Milestone: <Name>

Use this optional detailed profile when a milestone is an independently
acceptable product outcome and Standard/Heavy planning benefits from a retained
artifact. One outcome may include cohesive UI, API, data, and runtime support.
Review is normally a gate/node, and becomes its own milestone only for an
independent release, authority, or cross-milestone acceptance boundary. Use
[`CLAIM_EVIDENCE_TRUST.md`](../agent/CLAIM_EVIDENCE_TRUST.md#sage-trust-001)
for claim depth, fidelity, and currency.

## Outcome And Authority

- Claim IDs / product outcome:
- Supported entry and observable outcome:
- Composition / wiring in scope:
- Delivery / recovery boundary, if claimed:
- Required evidence depth / fidelity:
- Project authority and acceptance owner:
- Scope / non-goals:
- Governance level and permission mode:
- ACTIVE_CONTEXT:

## Acceptance And Execution

- Observable acceptance:
- Affected paths/contracts:
- Dependencies and useful serial/parallel boundaries:
- Project-required focused checks and final CI gate, if any:
- Human-only gates:
- Stop conditions:

Use one bounded loop by default. Graph, waves, lanes, controller/coder split,
packets, structural gates, adapters, and separate ledgers are conditional
profiles only. Delegation alone does not select Heavy. A shared toolchain is
serial only while mutable state is shared.

## Supporting Work

| Area | Bounded result | Owner/permission | Paths | Checks | Dependency |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `<UI/API/data/runtime/etc.>` | `<result>` | `<owner/mode>` | `<paths>` | `<checks>` | `<dependency>` |

Split this milestone only if a part cannot be accepted with the same product
outcome, needs a distinct scope/permission decision, or has an independent
release/acceptance boundary.

## Rollback (conditional)

Complete only for durable state, public contract, migration, or release change:

- owner and trigger:
- procedure:
- compatibility impact:
- post-rollback verification:

## Completion And Handoff

Apply `docs/SAGE_CORE.md#sage-completion-001`. Reference authority,
`ACTIVE_CONTEXT`, review/check evidence, and the project acceptance decision;
do not duplicate current status/findings/blockers/next action. A closeout is an
optional historical outcome index after acceptance, not an acceptance engine.
Reuse still-current evidence; supporting work and milestone count do not create
additional final proof runs.
